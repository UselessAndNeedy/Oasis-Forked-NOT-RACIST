===================================DISCLAIMER===================================

Much of the content in the mod is either copied, modified, or inspired by other mods. I try to make the mod as original as possible but none of it could happen without the "help" of others.
As such, others are allowed to freely copy this mod as long as they provide credit.
If you find yourself peeking into this mod's code, the majority is uncommented. Hopefully this does not make you break out in tears.
